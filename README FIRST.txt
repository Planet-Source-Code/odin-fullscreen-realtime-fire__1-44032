If you run the demo in the IDE, it will run extremely slowly.
You must compile the code and it will run much faster.
To exit the program, press Esc

TO COMPILE:
	When you choose File-->make, click on the options button.
	Then Choose the compile tab.
	Click on the Advanced Optimizations Button.
	Make sure all the options are checked.
	Then click Ok and click Ok again to compile.

I had some complaints about not using tabs on earlier releases,
so this time I used them. But please remember this is more of an
output program rather than using the code elsewhere.

If you like this code, please do vote and leave comments. I have put
a lot of time into this, so at least give me some feedback.

Enjoy!


Side Note:
	There is a button on the form and a label for FPS. This stuff is still updated, but since it
	is now fullscreen, this information will not be displayed. The reason this is still left in
	is so that you can change the program back into a windowed application simply by removing the
	directdraw code that changes the window resolution.


Inside each of the DoFire methods, you can change the intensity of the fire by simply changing the
amount of hotspots and the number of coldspots. Play around with these till you get something you like.
